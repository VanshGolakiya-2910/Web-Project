# Password Strength Checker

This project is an Angular-based Password Strength Checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria. The tool supports three modes: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, each with increasing levels of complexity in the evaluation process.

## Features

- **Basic Mode**: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Intermediate Mode**: In addition to the Basic checks, it ensures that the password is not in a predefined list of common passwords.
- **Advanced Mode**: Includes all checks from the Basic and Intermediate modes, and also evaluates the password based on personal details like First Name, Last Name, and Birth Date to prevent easy-to-guess passwords.

4. **Generate Secure Password**: Click the "Generate Secure Password" button to get a randomly generated password that meets the strength criteria.

5. **Advanced Mode**: When using the Advanced mode, fill in your personal details (First Name, Last Name, Birth Date) to ensure the password is not easily guessable based on this information.

## Testing

```bash
ng test
```

## Customization

- **Strength Meter Colors**: You can customize the color scheme of the strength meter by editing the `password-checker.component.css` file.
